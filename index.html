        <h2>About Gossly</h2>
        <p>Gossly is an Youtuber who does gaming, reviews, vlogs and much much more.
        He also does trolling, which I find it very funny. He started doing youtube way back in 2016, but quitted many channels
        due to lack of confidence, failure, discourage. But one time he made a new channel called "Gossly" and started to get
        many many attraction which boosted his confidence, and started doing youtube and became a Youtuber. I hope you join
        him through his youtube journey...
